        <!--Opening Paragraph-->
        <p>
            Creatine is one of the most widely researched and commonly used supplements in strength and resistance 
            training. Studies have shown that creatine supplementation increases the amount of phosphocreatine 
            stored in muscles, which helps the body produce energy more efficiently during short, high-intensity 
            activities such as weightlifting and sprinting. This increase in available energy can improve muscular 
            performance and delay fatigue during a workout. As a result, individuals who supplement with creatine 
            are often able to perform more repetitions, lift heavier weights, or sustain higher training intensity 
            compared to those who do not use creatine.

        <!--Closing Paragraph-->
        <p>
            While creatine does not directly build muscle, creatine enhances the body's ability to train at higher 
            intensities, which can lead to greater long-term gains when combined with proper exercise and nutrition. 
            Many common misconceptions about creatine have been disproven through scientific research, showing it to 
            be safe when used correctly. Understanding how creatine works allows adults and athletes alike to make 
            informed decisions about supplementation. When creatine is used with constant training and responsible 
            nutrition habits, it can be a valuable tool for supporting fitness goals.
